//! Synaptic — A Rust agent framework with LangChain-compatible architecture.
//!
//! This crate re-exports all Synaptic sub-crates for convenient single-import usage.
//! Enable features to control which modules are available.
//!
//! # Feature Flags
//!
//! | Feature | Description |
//! |---------|-------------|
//! | `default` | `runnables`, `prompts`, `parsers`, `tools`, `callbacks` |
//! | `model-utils` | `ProviderBackend`, `ScriptedChatModel`, wrappers (Retry, RateLimit, etc.) |
//! | `openai` | OpenAI ChatModel + Embeddings |
//! | `anthropic` | Anthropic ChatModel |
//! | `gemini` | Gemini ChatModel |
//! | `ollama` | Ollama ChatModel + Embeddings |
//! | `models` | All providers: openai + anthropic + gemini + ollama |
//! | `agent` | `default` + openai + graph + memory + middleware + store |
//! | `rag` | `default` + openai + retrieval + loaders + splitters + embeddings + vectorstores |
//! | `full` | All features enabled |
//!
//! # Quick Start
//!
//! ```rust,ignore
//! use synaptic::core::{ChatModel, Message, ChatRequest, ToolChoice};
//! use synaptic::openai::OpenAiChatModel;
//! use synaptic::runnables::{Runnable, RunnableLambda, RunnableAssign, RunnablePick};
//! ```

// Re-export internal crates under their original names so proc-macro generated code
// (which references `::synaptic::synaptic_core`, etc. via `proc-macro-crate` detection)
// can resolve correctly when downstream crates only depend on the `synaptic` facade.
